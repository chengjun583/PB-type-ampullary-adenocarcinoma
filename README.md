# PB-type-ampullary-adenocarcinoma
Ampullary adenocarcinoma (AAC) is a malignant neoplasm that arises within the ampullary complex, which could originate from three types of epithelial cells: biliary, pancreatic ductal, or duodenal. AAC can be classified into intestinal and pancreatobiliary types based on histopathology or immunohistochemistry. However, there are no biomarkers for further classification of pancreatobiliary-type AAC which has important implications for the treatment of this disease.

In this project, we performed histopathological analysis, survival analysis, and mutation analysis to infer the tumor origin of pancreatobiliary-type AAC. We found that pancreatobiliary-type AAC resembles pancreatic adenocarcinoma and differs from cholangiocarcinoma.

The data and code for the different analyses are in different folders as indicated by the folder names. Code is written in MATLAB, R, and Python. Sequentially run the scripts in each folder will reproduce the results.
