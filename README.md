Ampullary adenocarcinoma (AAC) can be classified into intestinal and pancreatobiliary types based on histopathology or immunohistochemistry. However, there are no biomarkers for further classification of pancreatobiliary-type AAC which has important implications for the treatment of this disease.In this project,we used computational pathological analysis and machine learning to To identify the tumor origin of pancreatobiliary-type AAC.
